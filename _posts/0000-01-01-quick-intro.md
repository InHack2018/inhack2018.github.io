### Hackathon

We are inviting student builders, programmers, designers, developers and
hackers for our first ever hackathon. Whether you are a veteran or completely
new to the scene, join us for a glorious day of coding!

A hackathon is a hacking marathon where creative and ambitious teams get
together to create software projects in a short amount of time. At the end of
the day, the projects will be presented to the judges and other participants.
