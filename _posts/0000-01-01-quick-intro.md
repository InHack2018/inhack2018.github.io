### Hackathon

We are inviting student builders, programmers, designers, developers and
hackers for our first ever hackathon. Whether you are a veteran or completely
new to the scene, join us for a glorious day of coding!

A hackathon is a hacking marathon where creative and ambitious teams get
together to create software projects in a short amount of time. At the end of
the day, the projects will be presented to the judges and other participants.

### Real Life Comes First

We love World of Warcraft, but we have families, friends and
jobs too. We don't play every day, and we don't expect you to
either.

If you are looking for a guild that understands and encourages
your life outside the game, we are are here for you.
