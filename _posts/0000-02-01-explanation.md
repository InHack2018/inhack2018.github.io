### Teams

Teams are put together by participants themselves, so you have a chance to code with your friends! Team size should be 2 to 5 people. For those wishing to hack solo, please state so on the registration form.

If you do not have a team, indicate so in the registration form and we will provide an opportunity to connect with other team-seekers before the event.

All the team members are required to register prior to the event. You can [register here](https://goo.gl/forms/67DeV5SXL0Pl24403). Registration closes on March 17. We have a limited number of spaces available so register soon!
