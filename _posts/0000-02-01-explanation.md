### Teams

Teams are put together by participants themselves, so you have a chance to code with your friends! Team size should be 2 to 5 people. Teams will be registered at the beginning of the event.

All the team members are required to register prior to the event. You can [register here](https://goo.gl/forms/67DeV5SXL0Pl24403). Registration closes on March 17.
