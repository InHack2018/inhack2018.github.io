### Teams

Teams are put together by participants themselves, so you have a chance to code with your friends! Team size should be 2 to 5 people. Teams will be registered at the beginning of the event.

All the team members are required to have a ticket. You can [get the ticket here](https://goo.gl/forms/67DeV5SXL0Pl24403). Tickets are required to help cover the costs of food and organization.
