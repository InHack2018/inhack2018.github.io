### Projects

Your project can be anything technology related (software or hardware)! It can be a website, an app, a game, a Raspberry Pi / Arduino project etc.

You can use any programming language or software you feel comfortable with. However, it is recommended to use only licensed copies of software.

Due to the Hackathon being shorter than usual you may prepare for your project beforehand. Bear in mind that the coding must be done on the hackathon day. Everything else (except the code), can be done ahead of time.
