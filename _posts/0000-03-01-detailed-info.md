### F.A.Q

<section markdown="1">

#### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is a hacking marathon where creative and ambitious teams get
together to create software projects in a short amount of time.

#### Where does InHack take place?

InHack is hosted at the Start-up Campus Haarlem (SUCH). SUCH is located on the university premises:
InHolland University of Applied Sciences, Bijdorplaan 15, 2015 CE Haarlem

#### Does InHack have a theme?

InHack does not have a theme. You can let your imagination run wild!

#### What can I make?

As long as it's tech related â€“ you can make anything you want.

#### Who can participate

Any InHolland Hogeschool student can participate.

#### How big should my team be?

Your team should consist of 2 to 5 people. If you are determined to hack solo, please send us an e-mail.

#### What if I don't have a team?

Register anyway! We will put you in contact with others who are looking for a team before the event. Don't forget to indicate this on the registration form.

#### What does it cost to participate?

Participation is FREE. We will provide the WiFi, workspace and other goodies.

#### Will there be food?

We will provide light snacks throughout the day and a dinner meal. There is also an Albert Heijn within a walking distance of the university as well as a number of restaurants and takeaways.

#### How do I join?

Easy, [sign up here](https://goo.gl/forms/67DeV5SXL0Pl24403). Don't forget though, max. 5 people per team.

#### What do I need to bring?

Yourself, your laptop and anything else that you need to be productive. We will supply internet and a place to plug in as well as some light snacks, drinks and dinner.

Don't forget your student card for admission.

#### 10 hours is not long enough. What can I do ahead of time?

You can plan and design what you want to make but keep the actual programming
for the day of the hackathon.

#### How will projects be judged?

Projects will be judged on technical complexity, originality, practicality,
completion and your presentation pitch. Don't be afraid, the judges know
which study year you're in, so they will know what your expected level of
knowledge is.

#### What about the rights to my work?

Anything you write, build or create belongs to you!

#### Are there any prizes?

Yes! Although prizes are not the driver behind hacking there will be some cool surprises from Genuino and Raspberry Pi for the winning team.

#### I'm not smart / my idea is not cool enough.

Sure you are. Hackathons are for learning, creating, getting inspired and
have fun while doing it!

#### I still have more questions.

We'd love to hear from you! E-mail us at inhack2018@gmail.com
