### Code of Conduct

We expect InHack to be a peaceful, tolerant and comfortable event. So, in
addition to the InHolland Code of conduct, we ask participants to bear in
mind the following.

-	Be respectful – This includes judges, mentors, organizers, volunteer,
  participants and everyone else on the premises.
-	Harrassment will not be tolerated – Any kind of slander/discrimination
  whether related to gender identity, body-size, race, ethnicity, nationality,
  sexuality, religious beliefs or anything else will result in a warning and
  removal from the event with no eligibility for reimbursements or refunds.
  This also includes cruelty, derogatory commentary, bullying and sexual harassment.
-	Respect your environment – As guests on the Start-up Campus, we ask everyone to
  not leave trash lying around and treat the space with care. Any damages incurred
  to university property will be dealt with according to university guidelines.
- Failure to comply with the Code of Conduct will result in the expulsion from the event. And depending on the severity of the offense, more serious consequences.

If you feel that someone is violating the Code of Conduct, talk to one of the volunteers at the event or e-mail us. We will take appropriate action immediately.

Feel free to e-mail us at inhack2018@gmail.com should you have more questions.
