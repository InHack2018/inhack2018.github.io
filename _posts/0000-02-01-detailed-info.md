### F.A.Q

<section markdown="1">

#### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is a hacking marathon where creative and ambitious teams get
together to create software projects in a short amount of time.

#### Does InHack have a theme?

Our Hackathon doesn't have a theme to encourage more people to join and
freedom of creativity.

#### What can I make?

As long as it's tech related – you can make anything you want.

#### Who can participate

Any InHolland Hogeschool student can participate.

#### How big should my team be?

Your team should consist of 3 to 5 people.

#### What does it cost to participate?

The cost of InHack is 7 euros. We will provide the WiFi, workspace, snacks, drinks and other goodies.

#### I'm not smart / my idea is not cool enough.

Sure you are. Hackathons are for learning, creating, getting inspired and
have fun while doing it!

#### How many people per team?

2 – 5 people per team.

#### How do I join?

Easy, sign up here [link]. Don't forget though, max. 5 people per team.

#### What do I need to bring?

Bring yourself, your laptop and anything else that you need to be productive.
We will supply internet and a place to plug in. There will also be some
food and drinks but don't be afraid to bring your own snacks.

Don't forget your student card for admission.

#### 10 hours is not long enough. What can I do ahead of time?

You can plan and design what you want to make but keep the actual programming
for the day of the hackathon.

#### How will projects be judged?

Projects will be judged on technical complexity, originality, practicality,
completion and your presentation pitch. Don't be afraid, the judges know
which study year you're in, so they will know what your expected level of
knowledge is.

#### I still have more questions.
